            <h3>MOS PIZZA</h3>
            <P> Pizza[a][1] is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of 
                leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked 
                at a high temperature,  traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

                The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern 
                Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania.
                [2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In 2009,
                Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed
                (TSG) dish. 
                Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. 
                Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants),
                Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] 
                In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and 
                is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In casual settings, however, 
                it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand.
                 Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home oven.</P>
