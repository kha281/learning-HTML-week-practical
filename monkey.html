           <h3>MONKEY</h3>
            <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, 
            also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes.
            Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included,
            monkeys and simians are synonyms.

            In 1812, Ã‰tienne Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together
            and established the name Catarrhini, "Old World monkeys" ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in French).[3][4][5]
            The extant sister of the Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") group is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).
            [3] Some nine million years before the divergence between the Cercopithecidae and the apes,
            [6] the Platyrrhini emerged within "monkeys" by migration to South America from Afro-Arabia (the Old World),
