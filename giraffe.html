          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3> 
        <p>The giraffe is alarge African hoofed mammal belonging
              to the genus Gifaffa .it is the tallest living terrestrial
              animal and the largest ruminant on Earth .
              Traditionally ,giraffes have been thought of as one
              species,Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.
              Most recently reseachers proposed dividing them into four
              extant species due to new reseach into their mitochondrial
              and nuclear DNA,and individual speciescan be distinguished 
              by their fur coat patterns.six valid extinct species of Giraffa
              from Africa and Pakistan are known from the fossil record.</p>
