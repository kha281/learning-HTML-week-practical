            <h3>COFFE SHOP</h3>
            <P>To ensure its effectiveness, give the board catchy-themed titles like  “Today’s  Fresh Picks,” 
            “ Chef’s Daily Creations,” or “ Brunch & Beyond Specials” to catch the attention of your customers.

             Additionally, divide the board into categories, such as Appetizers, Main Dishes, Desserts, and 
             Drinks, so customers can quickly find what they’re in the mood for. 

             Keep in mind to emphasize fresh, local ingredients used in today’s specials to inform guests what they’re going to eat.
